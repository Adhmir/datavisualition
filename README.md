# Datavisualization
## GGANIMATE in data from the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies

## The main objective is to demonstrate the expenses of Brazilian parliamentarians with a dynamic visualization, in order to arouse interest to readers.
The dataset is open access accessible, but few people can analyze it efficiently.
In addition, it is a great opportunity to train your skills with structured data. 
Although it has only one table, it has many columns, including States, Parties, Parliamentarians, Suppliers, among others. 
It can therefore be summarized and organized in many different and enlightening ways.
In this sense, adding dynamic graphics with gganimate as well as improving and arousing readers' interest is also an interesting challenge.


Best regards!
